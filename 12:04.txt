12/04 : Lessons part

Changes:
- single frame, multiple panels
- one review list for all lessons
- play button and pronunciation implemented


To do:
- deleteElement() in ReviewList class
- oops page (when there is no review words):
    Grace, is there a separate background for this?
- check images/words from word lists:
    some words are spelled differently or does not have corresponding words
    I tried to fix whatever I could find, but please modify or let me know
    when you get an IOException

Problems:
- program takes about 5-6 seconds to load initially
- pronunciation also takes 1-2 seconds to play
- figure out how to include JMF jars in github
